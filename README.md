# Demophoon's Template Vault

This vault is a template vault which mirrors what @demophoon uses on the daily.
It is based off of the [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) system for
organizing notes. The gist is that every note should fall into an abstract
category and have an incrementing id associated with the note. No more than 10
general categories may exist and each general category may have 10
subcategories. This vault contains a basic structure and automation for
following this format which you may find helpful.

## How to use

Clone this repo down and open it as a Vault within Obsidian. Start with the
[00.00 Index](0x Meta/00 Index/00.00 Index.md) note for instructions on how to
use this Vault.
